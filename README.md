# Repo-Generator Common

The Repo Generator is an OpenFoxes project designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of repositories.
Commonly used libraries should come preinstalled, default settings for IDEs should be configured, and developers should be guided through tasks via a CLI tool.
The "generator" itself consists of many individual parts (referred to as components here).
There are dedicated subprojects for different use cases, languages, and frameworks, as well as for the tasks to be performed.
This repository provides interfaces and methods that can be used across the various components and serves as the foundation for all other components.
